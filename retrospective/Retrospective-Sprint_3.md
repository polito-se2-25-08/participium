TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 08)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done :
- Total points committed vs done :
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team) :

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |         |    -   |            |              |
| n      |         |        |            |              |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 11h15m
  - Total hours spent 7h40m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 388
  - Coverage (if available) 84.6%
- Integration testing: 
  - Total hours estimated 3h
  - Total hours spent 2h
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 9h30m
  - Total hours spent 6h35m
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 2h
  - Total hours spent 3h
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted Prioritized Remediation Strategy
  - Total hours estimated estimated at sprint planning 1h
  - Total hours spent 4h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  - During our planning phase we focused on implementing more features underestimating how difficult it would've been and how much time we should've allocated to the technical debt management. This reason and some errors in the merge process made things more complicated and resulted in less stories presented.
  Another problem we faced was a non optimal collaboration which resulted in lateness in the planning stage.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
  - Our planning should consider more the technical debt sphere not only for its importance in the production process, but also because underestimating it meant adding more tasks that weren't done because of it. 

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We managed to add more tasks even if we overdid it and managed to do more testing
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Even if technically we achieved both we failed to have a balance between coding quantity and quality due to our

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  > Propose one or two 
  - Manage more shorter meetings to collaborate better
  - Prioritize code quality




- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Despite having merging issues we were able to code features for eight stories. Even if they are not considerable done they require a not so exessive work.
